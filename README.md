In this dataset, I have to find 
                 
# Revenue           =SUMIF(Movies[studio],"Marvel Studios",Movies[Revenue USD])
# Budget            =SUMIF(Movies[studio],"Marvel Studios", Movies[Budget USD])
# Profit/Loss       Revenue/Budget as B1
# Profit / Loss %   B1/Budget
# Market Share %    =Revenue/SUMIF(Movies[industry],"Hollywood", Movies[Revenue USD])
for Marvel studios 


# Mean        =AVERAGE(Movies[imdb_rating])
# Median      =MEDIAN(Movies[imdb_rating])
# Mode        =MODE(Movies[imdb_rating])

# Varience      =VAR.P(Movies[imdb_rating])
# Standard Deviation  ==STDEV.P(Movies[imdb_rating])


Revenue - Budget = Profit/Loss
Budget is the baseline for calculating the Profit/Loss percentage.
Market Value - Total revenue of all the movies.
Market Share: The revenue contribution of a particular industry to the overall market value.
